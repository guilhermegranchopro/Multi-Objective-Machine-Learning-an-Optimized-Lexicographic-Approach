# Multi-Objective Machine Learning: An Optimized Lexicographic Approach

This repository explores an optimized lexicographic approach for multi-objective machine learning, focusing on determining the tolerance threshold. The primary goal is to balance multiple competing objectives, such as model accuracy and complexity (e.g., L2 regularization).

## Project Context and Origin

This project is the result of an internship at the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP) focusing on machine learning and algorithms. It served as the final project for a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics and Technology from Instituto Superior Técnico and contributed to academic requirements at UFOP.

## Project Overview

In many machine learning scenarios, we aim to optimize more than one objective simultaneously. For instance, we might want a model that not only achieves high accuracy but is also simple and robust. This project investigates a lexicographic method to handle such multi-objective problems, where objectives are optimized sequentially based on their priority. A key aspect of this research is the determination of an appropriate tolerance threshold, which dictates how much degradation in a higher-priority objective is acceptable when optimizing a lower-priority one.

The core of this work is demonstrated in the `original.ipynb` notebook, which includes:

- Implementation of different multi-objective optimization techniques:
  - Weighted Sum Method
  - Chebyshev Scalarization
  - Lexicographic Optimization
- Analysis of Pareto frontiers generated by these methods.
- Investigation into the impact of varying tolerance levels in the lexicographic approach.
- Experiments primarily using the MNIST dataset for image classification.

## Key Concepts

- **Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO):** Deals with optimization problems involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously.
- **Lexicographic Method:** A hierarchical approach where objectives are ranked by importance and optimized sequentially. Once a higher-priority objective is optimized, a certain tolerance is allowed for its degradation while optimizing subsequent, lower-priority objectives.
- **Pareto Frontier:** A set of non-dominated solutions in a multi-objective optimization problem. A solution is Pareto optimal if no objective can be improved without worsening at least one other objective.
- **Tolerance Threshold:** In the lexicographic approach, this is a crucial parameter that defines the acceptable trade-off when moving from optimizing one objective to the next in the hierarchy.

## Methodology

The primary approach involves:

1. **Defining Objectives:** Typically, minimizing classification error (or maximizing accuracy) and minimizing model complexity (e.g., L2 norm of weights).

2. **Implementing Loss Functions:**
   - **Custom Weighted Sum Loss:** Combines multiple objectives into a single scalar function using weights.
   - **Chebyshev Loss:** Aims to minimize the maximum weighted deviation from an ideal objective vector.
   - **Lexicographic Approach:**
     - Prioritize objectives (e.g., error rate first, then model complexity).
     - Optimize the first objective.
     - Optimize the second objective, allowing the first objective's value to deviate within a defined tolerance.

3. **Training Neural Networks:** Using TensorFlow and Keras to build and train models.

4. **Analyzing Results:**
   - Plotting Pareto frontiers to visualize the trade-offs between objectives.
   - Investigating how different tolerance values in the lexicographic method affect the solution quality and the shape of the Pareto front.
   - Comparing the performance and characteristics of solutions obtained through different multi-objective strategies.
